Description: Tools for the calculation of effect sizes (standardised mean difference) and mean difference in pre-post controlled studies, including robust imputation of missing variances (standard deviation of changes) and correlations (Pearson correlation coefficient). The main function metacor_dual() implements several methods for imputing missing standard deviation of changes or Pearson correlation coefficient, and generates transparent imputation reports. Designed for meta-analyses with incomplete summary statistics. For more details on the methods, see Higgins et al. (2023) and Fu et al. (2013).
